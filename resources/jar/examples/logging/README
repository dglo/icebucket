README file for user's specified logging appenders:
Akbar Mokhtarani, LBNL, 11/18/2004

The LogginConsumer class has a method installDefaults(File inFile) that allows 
users pass a 'File' object and setup appenders of their choice with different
logging level than the default setup by the server. 
I have included example_1.xml as a sample of user's file that is passed 
to LogginConsumer.installDefaults(File) and ReadXMLFile.java, a simple 
example demonstrating how it is used.
